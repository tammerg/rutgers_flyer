# Rutgers Flyers
Full-Stack Group Project: We are creating a fully functioning full-stack app that shows our Rutgers pride!

## General Project Summary:
There's a lot to do / eat / see / play at Rutgers. We
need an effective way to categorize it all!
Our app will have a user registration / login system, and a way to add places for everyone to see. Only authenticated (i.e. logged in) users can leave reviews and ratings. There will be a basic filter that lets users narrow down their search (only 5 star places, restaurants, etc).
