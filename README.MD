# Rutgers Flyers
Full-Stack Group Project: We are creating a fully functioning full-stack app that shows our Rutgers pride!

## General Project Summary:
*There are a ton of places to eat at Rutgers. We're making an app for students to talk up their favorites.

*Our app will have a user registration / login system, and a way to add restaurants for everyone to see. Only authenticated (i.e. logged in) users can leave reviews and ratings. There will be a basic filter that lets users narrow down their search.
